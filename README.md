# ⚙️ Manual Transmission System

The goal of this project was to create a manual transmission system that has the ability to create forward and backward motion and brake at will. The strength of the design was demonstrated by attempting to move heavy weights vertically up and down within a time constraint. 

Included are:
- **CAD design of the final prototype**
- **Picture of the final product**
- **Stress Analaysis of Support Blocks**
- **Design Document**

## 🧠 What It Does

The system uses a dog clutch with a triple-gear mesh design to select between forward and reverse spur gears. A step-down gear
on the input shaft drives a secondary shaft with a bevel gear, which engages two bevel gears connected to spur gears on the output shaft. For braking, fins on the dog clutch engage a block on the base when shifted to neutral, effectively stopping the system. This design ensures efficient power transfer, directional control, and reliable braking.
