# ⚙️ Manual Transmission System

The goal of this project was to create a manual transmission system that has the ability to rotate forward and backward. The strength was demonstrated by attempting to move heavy weights vertically up and down within a time constraint. 

Included are:
- **CAD design of the final prototype**
- **Picture of the final product**
- **Stress Analaysis of Support Blocks**
- **Design Document**

## 🧠 What It Does

The system uses a dog clutch with a triple-gear mesh design to select between forward and reverse spur gears. A step-down gear
on the input shaft drives a secondary shaft with a bevel gear, which engages two bevel gears connected to spur gears on the output shaft. For braking, fins on the dog clutch engage a block on the base when shifted to neutral, effectively stopping the system. This design ensures efficient power transfer, directional control, and reliable braking.
